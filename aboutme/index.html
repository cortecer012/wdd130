  <h2>Julio Cesar Cortecero</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! Let me introduce myself. I am Julio Cesar Cortecero, I am from Colombia. I live in Cartagena in the caribbean coast of Colombia. I like to go to the beach, dance and listen to music.</p>
    <p>I have been member since 2014 and I had the opportunity to serve in a mission in La Paz, Bolivia. My Favorite scripture is Mosiah 2: 41.
      <p>I am a begginer of this but I love to learn and hope to obtain more education and serve others. Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
